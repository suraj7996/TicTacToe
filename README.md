# TicTacToe

It's just a basic part of my JS learning phase.
TicTacToe is a game in which the same sign in three consecutive boxes are happened to be placed is declared to be winner.
My project contains 9 boxes altogether and two signs i.e "X" and "0". If three boxes contain same sign either horizontally, vertically or diagonally then that sign wins.
If all the three boxes are filled but none of the signs wins then the game is tie.
It took 2 hours for me to create this game.
